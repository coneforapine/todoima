# Todo app with SwiftUI - MVVM
## Todomia
> Fun fact: I called the app Todoima because I acciendtally made a typo while just writing todo and it reminded me the japanese word ただいま (Tadaima) which means "I'm back" but mostly a way of saying "I'm back home".

### A small note about the project mvvm architecture
- In this project I have 3 different views and a single view model because for a small app I really didn't thought of writing seperate view models specifically for adding and marking todo items as completed would only make things a little bit more boilerplate-y especially for the createItem and markCompleted methods.
